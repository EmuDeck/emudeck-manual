# :material-help-box-multiple: What's EmuDeck?

<img src="/assets/deck.png" alt="EmuDeck guide">

EmuDeck is an installation script that helps you get started with emulation. It is not an all in one solution like some other software. Instead, it strives to provide the best possible official options to you, set up and ready to go.

!!! info "Is emulation legal?"

    Every country has its own laws, but the general rule of thumb is that Emulation is legal. Downloading games you don't own is not. **You need to provide your own ROMS and BIOS, EmuDeck won't provide those**

## Why EmuDeck?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- :simple-turborepo: **Original Emulators**<br> Software is either installed from the available Software Store (Discover) in Linux / SteamOS, or directly from the Emulators official repositories.
- :simple-awsorganizations: **Organised Structure**<br> Ready to roll. EmuDeck creates an easy to use `Emulation` folder with folders for your BIOS files and ROMs.
- :material-controller-classic: **Hotkeys**<br> Yup. Where possible these are consistent. By the nature of there being lots of different programs here sometimes EmuDeck will need to provide Steam Input Profiles to get these going.
- :material-fast-forward: **Best Settings**<br> EmuDeck does its best to optimize every emulator for your device. You can certainly tweak stuff, but it's recommended to do so with per-game settings.
- :material-update: **Emulator Updates**<br> These are available on the `Manage Emulators` page within the EmuDeck application.
- :material-monitor-screenshot: **Multiplatform**<br> EmuDeck is available for Linux / SteamOS, Windows, Mac _(BETA)_ and Android _(BETA)_
