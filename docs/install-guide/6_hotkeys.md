# :custom-joystick: Hotkeys

Every emulator has it's own set of hotkeys, you can check them in the ==Manage Emulators== section inside the EmuDeck App but there are some hotkeys that are universal to every emulator \*

In order to activate a Hotkey you need to press and hole the ==Hotkey Enabler== and then another button of the controller.
