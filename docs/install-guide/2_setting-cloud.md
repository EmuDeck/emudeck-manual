!!! bug "Chrome needed"

    If you are using Linux / SteamOS you need to set Chrome or any other Chromiun browser as the default browser in order to setup CloudSaves since a bug in Firefox prevents Cloud Saves to be installed.

!!! warning "Patreon"

    This is an exclusive feature only available for our supporters. You can support the project by clicking <a href="https://www.patreon.com/dragoonDorise" target="_blank">here</a>

This feature allows you to play any system that EmuDeck supports and have your saved games synced about all your devices on both Windows and Linux / SteamOS to get authentic crossplay.

**How it works**

CloudSync downloads your saved games when you start a game and uploads the saved games while you play in the background. CloudSync status can be monitored by watching its status notifications.

If a game fails to upload its saved state then CloudSync will warn you about possible conflicts on the next launch

## :material-cloud-upload: CloudBackup

This feature allows you to save and backup your games to a cloud provider of your choice while you are playing, so in case something happens to your device your saved games will be safe and sound in your cloud.
