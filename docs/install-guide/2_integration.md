<img src="/assets/install_guide/integration.png" alt="EmuDeck guide">
EmuDeck can be integrated with your system in different ways, each option gives you ways of easily access your games

## Low integration

EmuDeck will install EmulationStation DE as the launcher for your retro games. It will also add it to your Steam Library as a non Steam Game. _This is the recommended option for big libraries._

##Â High integration

EmuDeck will install Steam Rom Manager so you can use it to add your retro games as non Steam Games. It will categorise all games in different collections for each system. _Recommended for small to medium curated libraries._
