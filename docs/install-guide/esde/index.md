Allows you to manage and launch your ROMs through a single front-end application.

!!! info "Installation"

    ES-DE will be installed by default if you use *Easy Mode* and it's an optional feature in *Custom Mode*

### Launching ES-DE

After installing EmuDeck or ES-DE from ==Manage Emulators==, it will be added automatically to your Steam Library in the =="Non-Steam"== tab, open it and you'll be presented with a list of all your ROMS organised by system.

### Adding Games

Games are autodetected every time you start ES-DE, so there's nothing to do :)

### Adding Artwork

By default ES-DE doesn't show any artwork, the user has to manually start the parsing feature of ESDE.

- Go to ES-DE Settings by pressing ==START== then select ==SCRAPE==, ==SELECT SYSTEMS==, mark all of them, select ==BACK== and now select ==Start== in the menu, ES-DE will start downloading artwork for all your ROMS. While this is happening you can't launch any game and depending on the size of your library it could take from minutes to hours.
