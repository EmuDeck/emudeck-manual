<iframe width="1200" height="450" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XdRsHVxBW4k" title="Retro Library quick demo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

Retro Library is a Decky plugin that creates a new way to launch your retro games. It's currently in open beta so bugs are expected to appear.

!!! info "Important"

    This will be an alternative method for game launching, it won't replace ESDE or SRM in the future.

    To get Retro Library you need to download the EmuDeck Beta installer and run it on your Steam Deck, it will install over your current EmuDeck installation, replacing the EmuDeck App, it won't mess with your current installed emulators. Once installed you'll find a new _Retro Library_ section in the left navigation.

## Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- :simple-turborepo: **Integrated**<br> Retro Library creates a parallel Retro Library with all your retro games so you get the whole SteamOS experience without having to use other applications or cluttering your Steam Library.
- :material-update: **Last played games**<br> Your last played retro games will appear in your Steam recent tab games so you can go right back. User configurable for up to 8 games.
- :material-controller-classic: **Clutter Free**<br> Since Retro Library creates a new parallel retro library you wont get your Library full of non Steam games. Retro games are self contained in a new library in the Steam Menu
- :material-fast-forward: **Automatic artwork parsing**<br> No need to wait for artwork to download, you can start right up and Retro Library will download the artwork for your games automatically, you can see it updating your library in real time. *Choose your own artwork coming soon*
- :simple-awsorganizations: **Customizable**<br> We offer two themes: Retry and Steamy, both of them also can be configured to show either cover artwork or a screenshot + logo of the game.
- :material-monitor-screenshot: **Sky is the limit**<br> This is a first release, since this will be a direct EmuDeck project we can do almost whatever we want with no third party dependencies so this will become better with more features with time.

##Â Settings

You can customise Retro Library by accessing the Decky menu by hitting the (...) button.

### Recent Games

When you launch a retro game a temporary non steam game is created and this will appear in your recent played games in the Steam Deck home. You can set the number of retro games you want to show from 1 to 8.

### Theme Selection

By default we mimic the Steam Deck interface so you can feel right at home, but there's the option to enable _Retro Theme_ for a more fun theme.

### Theme Customisation

You can customise both the default and the retro Theme

**Horizontal navigation**
Default is top to bottom navigation but you can change it with this option.

**Games list - Show Logos**
Leave unchecked if you want to see Box art of your games, check it to see a collage of screenshot + logo.

!!! info "Tip"

    Extra feature if you have Retro Theme and Show logos enabled, this will show customized themes for some systems.
