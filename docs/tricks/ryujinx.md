### How to Configure Multiplayer



Ryujinx comes with a nifty auto-map feature that makes setting up multiplayer a breeze. To set up multiplayer, you simply need to enable the additional ports.

1. In **Game Mode**, open Ryujinx
   - You may add Ryujinx to Steam by using the `Emulators` parser in Steam ROM Manager
2. Open the `Input` settings in the `Settings` menu
3. For each controller you are using for Player 2, 3, 4, etc, click the respective `Configure` button
   - You do not need to adjust any settings for Player 1
4. Under `Input Device`
   - Player 2: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 1`
   - Player 3: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 2`
   - Player 4: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 3`
   - Player 5: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 4`
   - Player 6: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 5`
   - Player 7: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 6`
   - Player 8: `Steam Virtual Gamepad 7`
5. Using `Player 2` as an example:
   - On the `Player 2` configuration screen, after you have selected the appropriate `Input Device`, select your preferred `Controller Type` and click `Load` to the right of `Profile`
6. After you are finished enabling any additional players, click `Save` and you may open your game either directly as a shortcut in Steam or through ES-DE
7. (Optional) You may need to re-arrange the controller order in Game Mode for your controllers to function as expected. See [How to Re-Arrange the Controller Order](../../controls-and-hotkeys/steamos/external-controllers.md#how-to-re-arrange-the-controller-order) to learn how

### Special Characters



Files with special characters in the ROM name will not launch from steam. Rename your ROMs and remove the special character.

Known **Cases**:

- `é` in `Pokémon`
- `'` in `The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening`
- `+` and `'` in `Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury`

If you used Steam ROM Manager previously, re-run Steam ROM Manager after renaming your ROMs.

### How to Roll Back Ryujinx to an Older Version



#### Preface

Your ROMs launch using a script created by EmuDeck, `ryujinx.sh` in `Emulation/tools/launchers`.

The script launches the corresponding emulator in `/home/deck/Applications/publish` and **specifically looks** for two traits:

- The most recently downloaded version of the emulator in `/home/deck/Applications/publish`, based on the file/release date.
- The emulator name at the beginning of the file. Anything after the emulator name is ignored.
  - For example, if the latest version of the emulator is `1351` and you would like to downgrade to `1349`. When you download version `1349`, you could rename it to `EMULATORNAME-1349.AppImage`, and EmuDeck's script will ignore the `-1349` in the file name, allowing you to record which versions of the emulator you are using through the file name.

#### How to Roll Back Ryujinx

1. Download the version of the emulator you would like to use from GitHub: [https://github.com/GreemDev/Ryujinx/releases](https://github.com/GreemDev/Ryujinx/releases)
2. Move the downloaded emulator from Step 1 to `/home/deck/Applications/publish`
3. (Optional) Rename or delete the original emulator file
4. One at a time, right click `Ryujinx` and `Ryujinx.sh`, click `Properties`, click `Permissions`, check `Is executable`
5. Your games will now launch using the version of the emulator you downloaded

### How to Select Between Yuzu and Ryujinx in Game Mode



If you are using Steam ROM Manager and would like to run some games through Yuzu and others through Ryujinx, you may use Steam ROM Manager's exception manager to selectively run your games in your preferred emulator.

For further instructions, see [Steam ROM Manager: How to Hide ROMs on a Per Parser Basis](../../tools/steamos/steam-rom-manager.md#how-to-hide-roms-on-a-per-parser-basis).

If you are using ES-DE, you may use ES-DE's alternative emulators feature to select on a per-game basis which to run through Yuzu and which to run through Ryujinx.

For further instructions, see [ES-DE: How to Select a Different Emulator on a Per-Game Basis](../../tools/steamos/es-de.md#how-to-select-a-different-emulator-on-a-per-game-basis).
