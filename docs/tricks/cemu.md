### How to Configure Gyro

Gyro for Cemu requires SteamDeckGyroDSU. SteamDeckGyroDSU can be installed via EmuDeck, or it can be installed manually.

Gyro only works with the Wii U Gamepad (enabled by default). If you changed your controller layout to the Pro Controller, gyro will not work.

Read [How to Use the Wii U Pro Controller Configuration](#how-to-use-the-wii-u-pro-controller-configuration) to learn how to apply the Pro Controller layout on a per game basis.

Visit [SteamDeckGyroDSU](../../../emudeck-application/steamos/emudeck-application-101.md#steamdeckgyrodsu) to learn how to install and utilize SteamDeckGyroDSU.

### How to Configure Gyro With External Controllers

Some external controllers, including the Sony DualSense and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller feature gyro controls. Cemu allows you to use this gyro with a little bit of set up.

**Here's How**

#### Desktop Mode

1. Switch to Desktop Mode
2. Exit out of Steam
   - You may exit out of Steam a couple of different ways:
     - Right click the `Steam` icon in your taskbar and click `Exit Steam`
     - Open Steam, click the `Steam` button in the top left, click `Exit`
     - Open a terminal (Konsole) and enter `killall -9 steam`
     - Do note that clicking the the `X` button in the top right of the Steam window **will not** exit out of Steam
   - Your controls will switch to `Lizard Mode`. Use `L2` to right click, `R2` to left click, and the `Right Trackpad` to move the mouse
3. Click the bluetooth icon in the bottom right of your taskbar and connect your controller

### How to Use the Wii U Pro Controller Configuration

In some some games, the initial screen will prompt for a controller configuration: `Wii U Gamepad` or `Wii U Pro Controller`. Some games will automatically switch to the `Wii U Pro Controller` configuration if you choose it.

For example: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/214977370-2e0fece0-4166-45ea-b373-5599b4d2b7ca.png" height="400">

If you prefer to use the `Wii U Pro Controller` layout, you need to change the controller profile in Cemu. Make sure to change controller profiles on a per-game basis so it is persistent on EmuDeck updates.

**Tutorial**

1. Right click the game, click `Edit game profile`
2. Click the `Controller` tab
3. Change the profile to `Deck-P1`
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/226769652-9696e8f7-a91e-46e7-a553-156037b7e39e.png" height="300">
4. When you launch a game, one of the following two things will happen:
   - Some games will prompt you to choose a controller layout, select the `Wii U Pro Controller`
   - Some games will automatically switch to the `Wii U Pro Controller` configuration

### How to Mod Breath of the Wild

This section will cover how to mod Breath of the Wild using UKMM, a mod manager.

1. In `/home/deck/Applications`, create a `ukmm` folder
   - These folders are recommendations, you may use a folder of your choice but you will need to adjust any paths in future steps to the folders you select
2. Download the latest `ukmm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` file from [https://github.com/NiceneNerd/UKMM/releases](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/UKMM/releases) to `/home/deck/Applications/ukmm`
3. Right click `ukmm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz`, click `Extract archive here`
   - If it creates a subfolder, move the contents directly to `/home/deck/Applications/ukmm`
4. Download the attached `.sh` file and place it in `/home/deck/Applications/ukmm`
   - [ukmm-launcher.sh](../../configuration-files/ukmm-launcher.sh)
   - For the contents of the script, see [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmuDeck/emudeck.github.io/main/docs/configuration-files/ukmm-launcher.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmuDeck/emudeck.github.io/main/docs/configuration-files/ukmm-launcher.sh)
   - If you used a different folder than what was recommended in Step 1, make sure to open `ukmm-launcher.sh` in Kate or a text editor of your choice and update the paths to where you placed UKMM
5. Right click `ukmm-launcher.sh`, click `Properties`, click `Permissions`, check `Is Executable`
   - Use this file whenever you want to launch UKMM
   - You may add UKMM to Steam by right clicking it and clicking `Add to Steam`
6. Double click `ukmm-launcher.sh` to open it
7. Follow UKMM's documentation, [https://nicenenerd.github.io/UKMM/using-mods.html](https://nicenenerd.github.io/UKMM/using-mods.html) to learn how to mod Breath of the Wild
   - When deploying mods, the graphic pack folder will be located here: `/home/deck/.local/share/Cemu/graphicPacks`

### How to Roll Back Cemu to an Older Version

#### Preface

Your ROMs launch using a script created by EmuDeck, `cemu.sh` in `Emulation/tools/launchers`.

The script launches the corresponding emulator in `/home/deck/Applications` and **specifically looks** for two traits:

- The most recently downloaded version of the emulator in `/home/deck/Applications`, based on the file/release date.
- The emulator name at the beginning of the file. Anything after the emulator name is ignored.
  - For example, if the latest version of the emulator is `1351` and you would like to downgrade to `1349`. When you download version `1349`, you could rename it to `EMULATORNAME-1349.AppImage`, and EmuDeck's script will ignore the `-1349` in the file name, allowing you to record which versions of the emulator you are using through the file name.

#### How to Roll Back Cemu

1. Download the version of the emulator you would like to use from Cemu's GitHub: [https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases)
2. Move the downloaded emulator from Step 1 to `/home/deck/Applications`
3. (Optional) Rename or delete the original emulator file
4. Right click the newly downloaded emulator, click `Properties`, click `Permissions`, check `Is executable`
5. Your games will now launch using the version of the emulator you downloaded

### How to Configure Online Multiplayer Via Pretendo

You need a **physical Wii U** to play online multiplayer via Pretendo. You **cannot** play online multiplayer without a physical Wii U.

For instructions on how to dump the online files from a Wii U, see [https://cemu.cfw.guide/using-dumpling.html#copying-online-files-to-cemu](https://cemu.cfw.guide/using-dumpling.html#copying-online-files-to-cemu).

For more information on Pretendo, see [https://pretendo.network/](https://pretendo.network/).

For Pretendo's installation instructions, see [https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu).

1. From your Wii U, you will need to dump two files: `otp.bin` and `seeprom.bin`
2. On the Steam Deck, place these two files directly in the `$HOME/.local/share/Cemu` folder
   - Folders with a `.` (`.var`, `.local`, `.config`, etc.) at the beginning are hidden by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files` to see these folders
3. In Desktop Mode, open Cemu, click `Options`, `General Settings`, click `Account`, select your `PNID` in the `Active Account` drop-down menu and select `Pretendo` under `Network Service`
4. Pretendo is now configured for Cemu
