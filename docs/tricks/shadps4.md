## How to play games.

1. In `Desktop Mode`, open shadps4
2. Skip this step if you have already added your games to shadps4:
   - Either:
     - In the top left click, `File`, click `Install Packages (PKG)`, and install your PKG
     - For more information, read the [File Formats](#shadps4-file-formats) section
3. Right click your game, click `Create Shortcut`, click `Create Desktop Shortcut`
4. On your desktop, you should see an icon for your game. Move this icon to `Emulation/roms/ps4/shortcuts`
   - If your desktop shortcut contains special icons any special symbols (Ex: the copyright symbol, `©`), rename the desktop file to remove these symbols.
     - For example, rename `God Of War® Collection.desktop` to `God Of War Collection.desktop`, removing the `©` after `War`
5. Your game should now show up both in ES-DE and Steam Rom Manager
