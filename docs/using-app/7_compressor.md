# :custom-compress: Compressor

<img src="/assets/app/compression.png" alt="EmuDeck guide">

This tool allows you to compress several ROMs formats with up to 70% less space used per game.

!!! info "Steam Rom Manager"

    The compressor tools changes the format of your ROMs so if you are compressing ROMs that are already added to Steam using SRM you'll need to parse them again to update the entries to the new format.
