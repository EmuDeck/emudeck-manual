!!! warning "Windows Exclusive"

    This feature is exclusive to Windows devices and it's currently being tested in ==EmuDeck Early Access==

This tool replaces the way windows boots, instead of booting to the Windows Desktop, it will boot to Steam in Big Picture Mode with no Desktop loaded in the background. If you close Steam you'll be back to your Desktop until your restart where you'll be back to Steam Big Picture.

By doing this you can mimic the SteamOS experience in your Windows device.
