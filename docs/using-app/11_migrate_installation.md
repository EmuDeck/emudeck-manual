You can move your ==Emulation== folder anytime, this is specially useful if you've installed your ==Emulation== folder in your internal storage and you are running out of storage so you can move every game, bios, etc. to an SD Card or an external drive.

Just pick the Destination and click on ==Start Migration==, a progress window will appear indicating how is the migration going.
